# 🚗 Road Trip Planner – Data Science Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a data-driven Road Trip Planner that analyzes travel data and predicts travel time using machine learning.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze road trip data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Engineer meaningful features
- Build and evaluate a regression model to predict travel time

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Workflow
1. Data Loading & Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training (Linear Regression)
5. Model Evaluation (MAE, R² Score)

## 📈 Model Performance
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ~0.57
- R² Score: ~0.90
- Strong correlation between distance, speed, and travel time
